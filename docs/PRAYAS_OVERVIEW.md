# PRAYAS Project Overview

PRAYAS is an offline-first, GenAI-powered UPSC preparation companion built with Next.js 14 (App Router). It prioritizes zero-auth usage, local storage, and a calm, mentor-like UX while still delivering AI-backed planning, evaluation, and mentorship when online.

## Glimpse: Feature Snapshot
- Offline-first PWA with service worker caching and local data storage.
- Smart AI planner that creates daily study plans based on hours and target stage.
- UPSC Pulse: curated news by category + AI summaries + UPSC relevance.
- Testing & analytics: MCQ practice with topic accuracy tracking and charts.
- Answer evaluator: rubric-based feedback on written answers, plus optional image upload (Gemini).
- AI mentor chat with modes: strategy, motivation, counselling.
- Motivation & wellness: daily affirmations and burnout-aware guidance.

## In-Depth Feature Walkthrough

### 1) Offline-First PWA
- Pages and assets are cached for offline access.
- User data is stored locally in the browser (IndexedDB + localStorage).
- AI and news features require connectivity, but outputs are cached for later access.

### 2) Smart AI Planner
- Input: daily available hours + target stage (Prelims/Mains/Both).
- Output: a focused one-day plan with time blocks and micro-breaks.
- Stored locally with timestamped saves, so the latest plan is always available offline.
- Server Actions are used to call the AI provider.

### 3) UPSC Pulse (News + AI Summaries)
- Category-based news fetch (polity, economy, environment, IR, ethics).
- AI generates a 2-bullet summary and a short UPSC relevance note per article.
- News providers supported: GNews (default) or NewsAPI.
- Articles and summaries can be cached locally for offline reading.

### 4) Testing & Analytics
- Timed MCQ practice from a local question bank (JSON).
- Tracks attempts, accuracy, and topic-wise performance in IndexedDB.
- Visual analytics using a radar chart for topic coverage.
- Includes an optional image upload section to send handwritten answers to Gemini for feedback.

### 5) Answer Evaluator
- Text-based evaluation with rubric-driven feedback: structure, keywords, flow, tone, and improvements.
- Optional image upload for handwritten answers (Gemini only).
- Feedback is rendered as Markdown for clear formatting and readability.

### 6) AI Mentor
- Three modes: strategy, motivation, and counselling.
- Responses are designed to be calm, structured, and aspirant-friendly.
- Server route handles requests and returns concise replies.

### 7) Motivation & Wellness
- Daily affirmations generated by AI.
- Gentle wellness guidance and burnout-aware prompts.
- Encourages sustainable preparation habits.

## Architecture & Data Flow
- Next.js App Router with server actions and API routes for AI and news.
- AI requests go through a single provider-agnostic layer (`lib/ai.ts`).
- News requests are abstracted in `lib/news.ts` with provider switching.
- UI uses reusable Card components and section headers for consistency.

## AI Layer
- Providers supported: OpenAI, Gemini, Groq.
- Provider is selected via `AI_PROVIDER` in `.env.local`.
- Gemini supports optional image input for evaluator flows.
- Errors are surfaced in the UI for easier debugging.

## Storage Strategy
- IndexedDB stores plans, pulse items, analytics, and sessions.
- localStorage stores lightweight preferences (e.g., hours, target, last plan time).
- All user content stays on the device, aligning with privacy-first design.

## UX & Design System
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI patterns for consistent styling.
- Framer Motion adds subtle animations and transitions.
- Typography and color palette are designed for calm, focused reading.

## Configuration
Key `.env.local` variables:
- `AI_PROVIDER` = `openai` | `gemini` | `groq`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`
- `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_MODEL`
- `NEWS_PROVIDER` = `gnews` | `newsapi`
- `NEWS_API_KEY`

## Deployment
- Optimized for Vercel.
- Add env vars in the Vercel dashboard.
- PWA caching helps maintain offline support post-deployment.

## Future Scope Ideas
- Authentication and multi-device sync.
- Long-term analytics dashboards and streak tracking.
- Community study circles and peer feedback.
- Mentor marketplace with verified experts.
- Native mobile app with offline-first sync.

## Why This Architecture Works
- Offline-first design ensures usability even with unreliable connectivity.
- Server-based AI actions allow provider switching without UI changes.
- Local storage keeps user data private and latency low.
- Modular pages make it easy to expand with new UPSC-specific tools.
